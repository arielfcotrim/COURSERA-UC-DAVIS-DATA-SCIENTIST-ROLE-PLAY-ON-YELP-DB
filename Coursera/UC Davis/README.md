Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet
================================================================================================
This is a peer-reviewed SQL project from the UC Davis course, SQL for Data Science (Coursera platform).

The idea of the project was to provide a hands-on experience with
SQL and data analysis using the Yelp dataset.
The dataset is available at https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

I did this project while still studying QA and before even starting my very first job as a QA.
It was a fun and challenging project - at the time - and I learned a lot from it.
